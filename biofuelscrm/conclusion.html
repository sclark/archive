  <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think that 
    Biomass is a very efficient and effective way to make energy. It reuses and 
    recycles practically any thing organic. Of course it does pollute our air, 
    when it is burned but over all biomass is a good plan for the envirorment. 
    More people should use biomass as an alter energy form to light their light 
    bulbs.</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Biomass is a 
    very bad thing because it burns plants, however it is very efficent. I wish 
    that we could use more biomass. The good thing about biomass is that we are 
    now able to chemicaly get energy. We were not able to include this in our 
    website but you can look it up on www.eia.gov. Over all biomass is a great 
    way to make energy.</font></p>
