Viruses
 could pass through sterilization filter
 parasitic pathogens liv in a host
 examples
  HIV, Influenza, Small Pox, Herpes, Common cold
 specific to species
 structure
  nucleacic acid 
  surrounded by protein (capsamire)
  some have envelope
   custom transmembrane protein to aid with binding
  phage (infect bacteria)
   head (DNA in a icosohedral capsid)
   tail sheath
   tail fibers
 shapes
  helical (cylinder capsamires surrounding RNA)
  adenoviruses (icosahedral (2,3,5 fold) capsamires with glycoprotein surrounding DNA)
  influenza (enveloped virus with RNA and transmembrane glycoprotein)
  phage
 neucleac acid classification
  dsDNA
   Epsiten-Barr (mono), chicken pox, herpes simples 1/2, papilloma, small pox
  ssDNA
  dsRNA
  ssRNA(+) (can be immedieat mRNA)
   Togovirus, rhinovirus
  ssRNA(-)
   rabies, measles, flu
  ssRNA reversed to DNA
   retrovirus (HIV)
 phage infection (bacteria)
  lytic phage
   attach with receptors
   inject neucleaic acid
   degrade host DNA
   copy viral DNA and protiens
   assemble in cell
   lyse cell to go infect more
  lysogenic phage
   attach with receptors
   inject neucleaic acid
   neucleaic acid added to host genome
   cell divides with virus neucleaic virus
   copy viral DNA and protiens
   assemble in cell
   lyse cell to go infect more
 viral infection (animals)
  non-envelope
   virus binds
   inject neucleaic acid
   replicate neucleaic acid
   translates mRNA to capsid protein
   self assemble and exit cell
  envelope virus
   virus buds-in
   release neucleaic acid
   replicate neucleaic acid
   translates mRNA to capsid protein
   translates mRNA to transmembrane protein
    goes through ER and golgi
    coalese in a spot on membrane
   self assemble and bud off
  HIV
   virus buds-in
   release RNA
   reverse transcriptase RNA to RNA/DNA hybrid
   copy DNA to dsDNA
   insert dsDNA into genome
   (and wait...)
   translates mRNA to capsid protein
   translates mRNA to transmembrane protein
    goes through ER and golgi
    coalese in a spot on membrane
   self assemble and bud off
 SARS
  came from Bats
  RNA(+)
  moved around world
 Prions
  no neucleaic acid
  malformed protein that attaches to normal proteins making more malformed proteins
