Innate Immunity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZZLLqhLZ64)
 recognize many similar pathogens
 born with ability
 fast response time
 defences
  barriers
   skin with lower pH to kill some bacteria
   mucous membranes
   secretions (including mucous)
    eyes have lysezyme that digest cell wall of bacteria
  internal
   phagocytic cells enulf pathogen
   antimicrobial proteins neutralize pathgen
   inflamatory response swells area
   natrual killer cells
 cells
  pluripotent stem cells
   lymphoid stem cell
    lymphocyte - important for adaptave immunity
     B Cell - make antibodies
     T Cell
   myeloid stem cell
    erythrocytes (RBC's)
	platelets - bolld clotting
	monocytes - phagocytic cells involved in macrophages
	neutrophils - suicidal neutrophils
	eosinophils - kill paracytes with pantibodies
	basophils - release histamine
   mast cells - release histamine (related to alergies)
   natrual killer cells - attack general viruses and cancer
 lymphatic system
  intersticial fluid dumps into lymphatic vessel
   collects in lymph nodes (TODO: pumps at 9:54?)
  spleen collects B and T Cells
  appendix
  peyer's patch of small intestine
  thymus is where T Cells develope
 splinter
  brings in bacteria
  damaged tissue attract mast cells
  mast cells dump histamine and tumor neucrosis factor
  histamine lets phagocytem move out of capalaries
  phagocytes activate with tumor neucrosis factor
  phagocytes eat pathogen
   eats pathogen in a vaculoe with lysozome
   eats pathogen in a vacuole and TLR recognizes
    Toll-like Receptors (TLR) - recognize ds RNA, CpG DNA, Lipopolysacharide, anf Flagellin and trigger non-specific inflamation
 defensin
  recognizes membranes of pathogens
  cuts holed in membrane
