T Cells ()
 develope in thymus
  gene reagement
  positive selection
   must bind to your MHC
  negative selection
   will not self react (kill your cells)
 use TCR to bind antigen and MHC (HLC)
  antigen is a peptide
  MHC polymorphic (multiple shapes)
   self vs non-self
   critical for marking yourself
   class 1
    all cells but RBCs
    cytotoxic T Cells
    presents antigens present in host cell
     self: OK
     viral infection: not OK
     cancer (mutant protiens): not OK
   class 2
    only on profesional antigen presenting cells
     macrophage
     dendritic cell
     B Cell
 killer / cytotoxic / CD8+ T Cell activation
  activation
   TCR binds MHC1 + foreign peptide
   CD8 binds constant region (back) of MHC1
   cytokines activate (from the B Cell or macrophage)
  replication (clonal expansion)
  perforin release
  memory cells
 helper / CD4+ T Cell activaion
  activation
   TCR binds MHC2 + foreign peptide
   CD4 binds constant region (back) of MHC2
   cytokines activate (from the B Cell or macrophage)
  replication (clonal expansion)
  make cytokines (super important cytokines)
   direct and coordinate orders for B and Cytotoxic T Cells
  memory cells
 T Regulation Cell activation
  shutsdown T Cells
