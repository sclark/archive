Adaptive Immunity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o-KM9AgBZs)
 learns new pathogens
 lymphocites able to amplify correct antibodies
 B and T Cells
  only work against certian antigens
  1 million B Cell Receptors
  10 million T Cell Receptors
 antigen
  foreign body
  made of protein
  certian antigenic determinants (shapes) will trigger immune response
 B Cells
  Receptors
   have variable region at top
    composed of V(D)J region
	100 V genes, 30 D genes, 6 J genes
	get one gene from each region spliced together
	(can also change tails due to alternative splicing)
    extra nucleotides added between gene segments
   quaternary structure
   have constant region tails
  once a B Cell is triggered it undergoes mitosis (clonal expansion)
  eventually some B Cells diferentiate into Plasma Cells
  Plasma Cells release antibodies that were stuck on membrane before
  some dont diferentiate and act as Memory Cells
  Memroy Cells circulate in higere numbers incase the infection should come again
   easier to activate
   vaccine trick immune system by presenting a killed pathogen to create memory cell
  selection
   1. B Cell must make functional antibody on surface
   2. antibody must not bind to self-antigen
 Antibodies
  method 1
   bind to virus and bacteria preventing mitosis
   bind bacteria together in a group (Aggulnation)
    eaten by macrophages
   antibody pathogen complex is recognized as a substrate in macrophages due to antibody tail
  method 2
   attract Complement
   inserts lesion proteins
   cell lysis
 Cascade
  phaovcyte engulfs virus
  phagocyte binds to Helper T Cell
  Helper T Cell releases cytokines as a growth factor
  B and T Cells must be near Helper T Cells
   happens in spleen
