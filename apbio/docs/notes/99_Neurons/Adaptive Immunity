Neurons ()
 cell body - has nucleus
 dendrites - recieveing end
 axon/axon terminals - send message down
 concentration gradient
  significant difference compared to other cells
  more K+ in cell
  more Na+ outside
  more Cl- outside
  more negative inside than outside
  membrane potential (voltage)
  maintained by sodium-potassium pump
   active transport with ATP
   3 Na+ out
   2 K+ in
 activation (via Na+ and K+)
  ligand or receptor gated chanels
   allow ions to move in response to stimulus
  voltage gated chanels
   allow ions to move in respones to voltagge change
  resting
   Na+ gates closed (on outside not on inside)
   K+ gates closed
  ligand gated channels bind ligand
  membrane potential increaces
  IF threshold reached
  voltage (Na+) gates open
   Na+ flows in rapidly (depolarization)
  voltage (Na+) gates close
  voltage (K+) gates open
   K+ flows out rapidly (repolarization)
    positive pushes out
    higher concentration on inside
  voltage (K+) gates close
  sodium-potasium pump resets resting state
 schwan cells
  protect cells from changes and activating
  leave small section unprocted
  less distance to travel
  MS
   signal will slow down
 synapse (transmission between neurons)
  axon terminal pushes into the dendrite to make connection
  axon terminal action potential causes release of pre-made neuro transmitter molecules vesicals
  NTM binds to receptor gated chanels
   can cause depoliarization (Na+) (activating or stimulating)
    may get an action potential
   can cause hyperpolarization (K+) (inhibiting)
    makes harder to cause action potential in neuron
  NTM either degraded or re-bsorbed
