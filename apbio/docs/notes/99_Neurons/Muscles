Muscels ()
 skelatal muscle
  sarcomere - unit of contraction
   thick filaments (mysine)
   thin fillaments (actin)
   when relaxed, alot of space between filaments
   when contracting, thick filamens pull in thin fillaments
  pull all the way along
  attached to bones to move them
  only contract, so they come in pairs
  chemically
   myosin head pulls back from thin fillament with ATP
   binds back to thin fillament farther up
   repeat
 trigger by neuron
  neuron tiggers action potential outside muscell side
  musecls cells use tubes from outside into inside of cell
  tiggers Ca++ release from reticulum around sacomeres
  Ca++ removes regulatory fibers on thin filament
