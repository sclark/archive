Evolving Populations ()
 individuals cannot evolve
 many mutations will not effect protien function
 Sources of New Varriation
  mutations (in gamites)
   mutation rate related to acuraccy of DNA polymerase
   most mutations are not good in complex organisms
  changes in gene number or position
  reporduction
   crossing over
   independent asortment
 population - a group of oragnaism of same species that berde together and dont breed out of group
  gene pool - all of alleles and porportions in the population
 Hardy-Weinberg
  in unchanging populkation, frequencies always the same generation after generation
  equilibrium conditions
   no mutatuion (causes new alleles)
   random mating (geography, religion, culture)
   no natraual selection (from selection pressure)
   large population (large sample size)
   no gene flow (mating with other populations)
  decriber simple population dynamics
  equations
   p + q = 1
   p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
   p - frequence dominant allele
   q - frequency recessive allele
   p^2 - frequency of homozygous dominant
   q^2 - frequency of homozygous recessive
   2pq - frequency of heterozygotes
  populations not in equilibrium
   genetic drift - small sample size (some times causing loss of less frequent alleles)
    founder effect - small number of indivuduals leaves and created a new population geographically isolated
    bottleneck effect - majority of popuation wiped out and survivors did so by chance not better traits
     cheats hunted at random just for fur
   gene flow - mating with other populations
    brids in netherlands
   natrual slecection - selection of traits better suited for enviroment
    artifical selection - manmade natrual slection (elephants hunted for tusks, small tusked elephants survive)
    relative fitness - contribution individual make to next generation's gene pool
    directional selection - one extreme is more favorable
    disruptive slection - pushes organisms to extremes (middle are not good enough at eiher end, out competed by either end)
    stabalizing selection - pushes organisms to middle ground
    balancing slection - having two traits is good for everyall population
     heterozygote advantage - differnt phenotype that homozygous that provides advantage (sickel cell anemia)
    feequency dependence selection - disadvantage to be siginificantly in majority or minority (eat scales off side of fish with mouthes on one side, as prey lean the side to guard, opposite sided fish are more favored, numbers change for generaton to generation as canabials react)
    diploid organism - preserves variability (also hampers selection though b/c benifital traits from Mom hampered from Dad)
    sexiual selection - natrual selection specifically of traits effecting reproduction (attracting a mate, fertility)
