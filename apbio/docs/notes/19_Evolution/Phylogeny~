Phylogeny
 invented by Laneaous
  taxonomist
 classifies animals
  groups are called taxons
  groups created based on anatomical differences
 grouping by evolutionary relatedness
  basil taxon - branched off very early in process
  rooted tree - all organisms go back to common ancestor
  length of lines proportional to different things
 creation
  look for:
   shared ancestral characteristics inherited by group from ancestor
   shared derived characteristics that define smaller part of tree (four legs)
 convergent evolution - structure that appears and function similarly but is not derived from common ancestor
  can prove through molecular evidence, normally unambiguous
   figure out what mutations must have occurred
    find parsimony (shortest path of mutations b/t strands)
 monophyletic group - organims in group traced back to single ancestor
 paraphyletic group - all derived from common ancestor, but missing an organism
 polyphyletic group - all derived from common ancestor puls an extra organism
 Molecular Clock
  calibrate using known pair (species been apart for 100,000 years and species have 100 differences)
   one change every 1000 years
   new spiece with 80 differences is 80,000 years apart
   assume steady consistant evolution
    use Mitochondrial genes (not recombining)
 interprest Phylogenetic trees
  assume common ancestor has traits of both living organisms
  classify new species or unkonwn species
  trees are ever chaniging
   change from 5 groups to 3 based on DNA sequencing
   genes can move from one species to another (mitochondria to humans)
