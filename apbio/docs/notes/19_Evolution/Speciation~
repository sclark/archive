Speciation
 Prezygotic barriers - things that keep organisms from mating
  (cannot mate)
  habitat isolation - in different locations cannot get across mountian to mate
  temporal isolation - plant open flowers at night vs at day
  behavioral isolation - dont dance the right way, not mating
  (try to mate)
  mechanical isolation - cant connect...
  gamite isolation - receptors may not bind gamites  
 Postzygotic barriers - things that keep organisms progeny from surviving
  hybrid viability - progeny might just not survive
  hybrid fertility - donkey and horse make a mule that cannot reproduce
  hrbrid break down - can reproduce once but not after that
 Allopatric - new species seperated geographically
 Sympatric - new species forms without geography isolation
 New Species
  different number of chromosomes
   lineing up cannot happen in metaphase
  hybrid zone - on verge of either side of new species
  diversion
   reinforcement - new species further diferentiate
   fusion - two species come back togethr as one
   stability - two species remain different
  graual model - spieies slowly diferntiate over time
  punctuated model - species seperated suddenly then stabilized
   happend dut to gene switches (enhancers, promoters)
