Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
 allele+phenotype frequencies stay consistent generation to generation
 1. Large Population
  small population - genetic drift - change due to chance
   bottle neck effect - group of species is wiped out (natural disaster)
   founder effect - group of species is separated and begins anew
 2. No Gene Flow
  gene-flow - mixing with other species
 3. Random Mating
  non-random mating - geography makes individuals more likely to mate
 4. No Natural Selection
  natural selection - causes population to be better fit
   sexual selection
   heterozygote
   sexual selection
   stability
   directional
   disruptive
 5. No Mutation
  mutation - adds alleles and genotypes
 Equations
  p + q = 1
   p - frequency of dominant allele
   q - frequency of recessive allele
  p^2 + 2pq + q^2
   p^2 - frequency of dominant genotype
   2pq - frequency of heterozygote genotype
   q^2 - frequency of recessive genotype
  Ex: If 16% of a sheep population is white, what is the % of heterozygotes
   q^2 = .16
   q = .4
   p = 1 - .4 = .6
   2pq = 2(.6)(.4)=.48
  Ex: If you have 600 sheep how many homozygous dominants
   p^2=.6^2=.36
   .36*600=216
