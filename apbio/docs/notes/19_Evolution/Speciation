Specialization
 Prezygotic barriers - things that keep organisms from mating
  (cannot mate)
  habitat isolation - in different locations cannot get across mountain to mate
  temporal isolation - plant open flowers at night vs at day
  behavioral isolation - don't dance the right way, not mating
  (try to mate)
  mechanical isolation - cant connect...
  gamete isolation - receptors may not bind gametes  
 Postzygotic barriers - things that keep organisms progeny from surviving
  hybrid viability - progeny might just not survive
  hybrid fertility - donkey and horse make a mule that cannot reproduce
  hybrid break down - can reproduce once but not after that
 Allopatric - new species separated geographically
 Sympatric - new species forms without geography isolation
 New Species
  different number of chromosomes
   lining up cannot happen in metaphase
  hybrid zone - on verge of either side of new species
  diversion
   reinforcement - new species further differentiate
   fusion - two species come back together as one
   stability - two species remain different
  gradual model - species slowly differentiate over time
  punctuated model - species separated suddenly then stabilized
   happens due to gene switches (enhancers, promoters)
