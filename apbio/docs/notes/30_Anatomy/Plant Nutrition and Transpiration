Plant Nutrition and Transpiration ()
 CO2 from air
 H2O, N, S, Mg, P, Cl, O, K, Ca from roots
 missing nutrients
  Fe defiency - yellow leaves
  H2O
   in healthy plant: Psi = 0 (pressure potential balenced by solute)
   in unhealthy plant: Psi = - (no pressure potential and negative solute potential
 obtaining ions
  pump out H+ ions
  pump out CO2 (CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 -> HCO3- + H+)
  H+ binds to clay (-) forcing off other ions
 root symbiosis
  Fungus
   root send signals to fungus microrisae
   fungus grows hypha into root
   incrace surface are of root
  N fixation
   root send signals for rhizobia
   rhizobia grows in plant and forms a nodule
   rizohbia responsible for N fixation
   without rizhobia
    nitrifying bacteria turn N2 to NO3- outside root
    nitorogenase fixes N2 to 2NH3
    touch sensitive plants eat other organisms
    grow plants together for better N in soil
 xylem
  symplast path - water moves in inter cell chanels through the cell
  autoplast path - water moves in intra cell chanels
  trans-membrane - water moves through each membrane
  casparian strip - seal plant uses as one way chack valve and flow meter
   water hits this after eother path
   transported though cell into xylem and phloem (steele)
  transpiration
   adhesion and cohesion
    xylem made of trachea cells (cellusoe)
    alchol groups allow cohesion
   stomata open allowing H2O to evaporate
    pulls more water from bottom
    how they work
     day:   pump H+ out, K+ and Cl- enter
            take up H2O
            puff up and open
     night: H2O, K+ and Cl- diffuse out
            puff down and close
 phloem
  sievetube elements
  carry sucrose (in H2O) from source (leaves) to sink (fruit)
  needs xylem flow of water
