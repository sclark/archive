Gas Exchange ()
 gills
  water passes through gills into membrane system
  rely on dissolved O2 in water
  always must have water passing over gills
  use counter current exchange
  counter current exchange goes to a 100-0 mix
   blood: 100  80  45  20  50  <
   water: 100  75  50  25  50  >
  concurent only goes to a 50-50 mix
   blood: 0    25  50  50  50  >
   water: 100  75  50  50  50  >
 trachea system
  tubes through out body
  enter/exit body through holes in animal
  the small tubes (capalaries) carr out gas exchange
  body movement pumps air
   must move to get air
 lungs
  trachea, brochhi, bronchieoles bring air to avoli
  O2 diffuses into capalaries into RBC through the membrane of aveoli
  diaphram pulls expands lungs
   when relaxed, forces air out
  blood detects pH and CO2
   CO2 is acidic in blood
   medula in brain detects (high CO2) this and speeds up heart and breathing
  binding of O2 to hemoglobin

   CO2 + H2O <-> H+ + HCO3-
