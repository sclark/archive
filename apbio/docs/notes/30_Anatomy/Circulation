Circulation ()
 molusk
  open circulatory system
   heart pump bloods through arteries
   blood drains into pools
   pools drain back to heart
 segmented worm
  closed circulatory system (first)
   use veins to bring blood back to heart
   O2 difuses thorough skin into blood vessile
 blood vessels
  artery -> arterioles -> capalaries -> venules -> vein -> (liver or kidney) -> heart
  artery - endothelium, elastin, smooth muscel, elastin, connective tissue
  vein - endothelium, smooth muscel, connective tisse
  capalariy beds can shutdown capalaries and open them up
  brain controls via hormones (hypothalamous, pituatary, (adrenal) glands)
 evolution
  moving muscels forces blood through veins
  veins have valves to prevent blood from flowing backward
  fish
   2 chamber heart
    heart -(poor)> gills -(rich)> capalaries -(poor)> veins -(poor)> heart
  lung-fish
   3 chamber heart
    heart -(mix)> gills -(mix)> capalaries -(poor)> veins -(poor)> heart
                                lung -(rich)> heart
  amphibians
   3.5 chamber heart
    same as lung-fish
    missing complete segmentation of ventricle
  reptile
   3.5 camber heart
    more segmentation
  mammal (first birds)
   4 chamber heart
 important vesselc
  corotid artery - take blood to brain
  jugular vein - return blood from brain
  illiac - vessels to legs
 human heart
  (superior or inferior) vena cava -> right atrium -> right ventricle -> pulmenary artery -(...)> left atrium -> left ventricle -> aorta
  valves
   heart mumurs happen when blood flows backward
  cardiac cycle
   diastole - lowest blood pressure
   SA node fires
   ventricles fill
   VA node fires
   systole - higest blood pressure
 blood
  water - dissolves salts and protien (bicarb)
  protein - imunoglobins
  cells
   bone marrow can differentiate into any
   RBC's - carry O2
   White BC's - immune system
   platelets - fragments of cells in blood clotting
  clotting
   enzymes make fibrin
   fibrin capture RBC's in mesh work (scaffolding)
   factor 8 - requred for clotting and hemophiliacs cannot
