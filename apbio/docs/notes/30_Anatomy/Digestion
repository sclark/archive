Digestion ()
 Calories
  calorie - heat required to raise temp 1g H2O by 1C
  Calorie = 100*calorie
 Foods we Eat
  carbohydrates (grain) goes to fat (long term storage) (4C/g)
   contain celluose (cannot digest, so...) fiber
  lipids (milk and meat) store energy (9C/g)
   saturated vs unsatursated vs trans-fats
  protein goes to enzymes (no for energy) (4C/g)
   need 8 enzymes that cannot be made in body
    meat can provide these
    plants cannot provide this (lack Isoleucine and Lysine)
  mineaals come from balenced diet
  vitamins "    "    "        "
   can OD on A, D, E, K, b/c not water soluble
   water soluble vitamines expelled thorugh urine
 Ingestion (mouth - MD and CD)
  salivary glands release amalyase to break down carbohydrates
  mouth creates bolus
  (epigloutus closes entrance to trachea)
  bolus moves down esogous by peristalsis
 Digestion (stomach, s. intenstine - MD and CD)
  stomach
   sphincters control pasage of food
   large stomach surface area
   stomach mixes food and gastric juice
    gastric juice secreted from gastric pits
     chief and pariatal cells secrete Pepsinogen and HCl (and mucus)
     HCl activvates Pepsinogen to Pepsin outside cell
     kill bacteria
   created chyme - food and gastric juice
   ulcers - HCl eats stomach lining due to lack of mucus
    formally thought due to stress, now thought to be due to helicobacteria
  small intestine (1/3)
   liver and pancreas release enzymes to break down carbohydrates, protein, and lipids
    liver (and gallbladder) makes bile - emulsified fat to make it easier to digest
    pancreas makes enzymes and buffering solution
 Enzyme Break
  -sin - digest protein to peptides
  -ase - enzyme
 Absorbtion
  small intenstine (2/3)
   villi - absorb nutrients into blood (even have micro villi)
    macro molecules go though epitheal cells into capalaries
 Elimination
  large intestine
   reabsorb H2O and ions
   dead bacteria leave body
  appendix
   relative of cecum in other animals
   houses good bacteria to restore balance to large intestine in emergency
