Translation ()
 tRNA - delivers amino acids
  shaped like a T
  single strand of RNA that is H-bonding
  has anti-codon to attach to codon
  amino acid is on opposite side
 tRNA synthase - binds amino acid to tRNA
  uses ATP and GTP
 Ribosome
  Structure
   large and small subunits
   E,P,A sites for exit,protein,acceptor respectively
  Process
   small subunti scans for AUG start codon before attaching large subunit
   Creation of Amino Acid Chain
    tRNA bindes to mRNA in A of Ribosome (if stop codon jump to Stop Codon)
    amino acids betwen P and A sites conected with peptide bond using GTP
    tRNA shifted down sites using GTP (A->P,P->E)
    tRNA in E site leaves b/c nolonger attracted to mRNA
    repeat until stop codon
   Stop Codon
    eventually binds Release factor to stop codon in site A releasing protein and breaking ribosomal subunits using 2 GTP
     protein will fold
   RoughER Synthesis (happens simultanious with Creation of Amino Acid Chain)
     after ~12-18 amino acids atached
     Signal Peptide at end of amino acid chain binds SRP (Signal Recognition Particle)
     SRP drags Robosome and amino acid chain to SRP Receptor Protein (dock) on ROughER
     Signal Peptide removed by SRP Receptor Protein (no start codon amino acid)
 Bacteria
  make RNA and translate immedieatly
  many Ribosomes attached to mRNA from RNA polymerase (long chains)
   allows for quick protein creation
