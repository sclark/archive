Operons ()
 only in Prokaryotes
 Parts
  promoter - in DNA attracts RNA polymerase
  operator - regulatory protein binding site
  structural genes - code for proteins
  (all related to a single process)
 Tryptophan synthesis: trip operon
  need tryptophan all the time, so operon is constintuantly (normally) on ∴ repressible
  5 structural genes make enzymes to make tryptophan
 Lactose cleaving: lac operon
  only need enzyme when eating lactose, so operon is constintually off ∴ inducible protein
  absence of lactose, repressor is bound to operator, operator OFF
  presence of lactose, represor falls off of operator, operator ON
   allolactose is the inducer
  cAMP used to indicate nutrient level of cells
   low glucose, high cAMP
    cAMP binds CAP (CRP) to alostericaly regulate it
    complex binds to promoter
    attracts RNA polymerase
    (see table)
