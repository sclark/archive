 Electron Transport Chain (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3gnaQg7fk)
  AKA Oxidative phosphorylation or ETC
  Uses O2
   O2 is lowest energy and end of ETC
  Takes place on membrane of Mitochondria
  NADH + FADH2 + O2 -> ATP + H2O
  in Aerobic cells
  Process
   NADH loses e- to start of ETC
    Integral proteins use released energy down ETC to pump H+ ions into inter membrane area
    NADH -> NAD+ + 3H+
    FADH2 -> FAD + 2H+
   H+ ions move down concentration gradient through ATP Synthase
    H+ + ADP -> ATP
    produce ~24-34 ATP
    hibernation produces protines for H+ to be moved w/out ATP Synthase
   Stopping of ETC
    W/out O2 ETC will stop
    CO and CN bring to proteins in ETC stopping it
 Fermentation (ATP w/out O2)
  in (An)aerobic cells
  gets rid of waste
  resets components (NADH)
  Ethanol: Glycolosis -> (+ATP) 2Pyruvate + 2NADH -> 2Ethanol +2NAD+ + CO2
  Lactate: Glycolosis -> (+ATP) 2Pyruvate + 2NADH -> 2Lactate +2NAD+ + CO2
 Other Cellular Respiration Inputs
  Fatty acids -> Acetyl CoA -> Citric Acid Cycle -> ETC -> ATP
  Proteins -> Citric Acid Cycle -> ETC -> ATP
  Glycerol -> Pyruvate -> Acetyl CoA -> Citric Acid Cycle -> ETC -> ATP
 Facultative Anaerobes - can use o2 or not
 Oligated Aerobes/Anaerobes - have to use O2 / not use O2
