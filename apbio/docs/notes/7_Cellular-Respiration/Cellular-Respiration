Cellular Respiration (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGLN0i5XsHk)
 Overall Reaction: C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (ATP)
 Glycolosis
  No O2
  Takes place in cytoplasm
  Glucose + 2ATP -> 4ATP + 2NADH + 2H+ + 2Pyruvate
  Process
   Energy Investment Phase: (Glucose + 2ATP)
    Glucose + ATP -> Glucose 6-phosphate (phosphate on 6th carbon)
    Glucose 6-phosphate + ATP -> Fructose 6-phosphate
     products and reactants are isomers
    Fructose 6-phosphate + ATP -(Phosphofructokinase)> Fructose 1,6-biphosphate (symetrical)
    Fructose 1,6-biphosphate -> Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) + Dihydroxacetone phosphate (DHAP)
     products are isomers
   Energy Payoff Phase: (4ATP + 2NADH + 2H+ + 2Pyruvate)
    Substrate Level Phosphorylation
     Substrate (w/ P) + ADP -(enzyme)> product + ATP
     2G3P (really 1DAHP) + 2NADH + 2P -> 1,3-Biphosphorglycerate
     21,3-Biphosphorglycerate + 2ADP -> 2ATP + 3-Phosphoglycase
     Phosphate moved to O to be made unstable
     Phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) + 2ADP -> 2ATP + Pyruvate
 Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)
  No O2
  Takes place in Mitochondrial matrix
  2ATP + 2Pyruvate + 6NAD+ -> 6CO2 + 6NADH + 2FADH2 + 4ATP
  Process
   Pyruvate + NAD+ -> C + 2-carbon-chain + NADH
   2-carbon-chain + CoA -> Acetyl CoA
   Oxalocetate + Acetyl CoA -> Citrate
   carbons ripped off to form CO2, energy captured in NADH+FADH2, ATP fromed at Substrate level phosphorylation
    2C -> 3NADH + FADH2 + ATP
