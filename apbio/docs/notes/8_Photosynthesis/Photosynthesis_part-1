Photosynthesis (part 1) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdFsCBc_3Sk)
 Light Energy -> Chemical Energy
 Stages
  light: NADPH + ATP
  calvin cycle: glucose
 Evolution
  early organisms (heterotrophes) - eat different things
  glycolosis (and fermentation) - break down carbon chains
   invented by cyanobacteria
  photosynthesis - don't compete with glycolosis
  aerobic respiration - use produced O2
 Organisms
  Eucaryotics
   angiosperms - produce flowers
   gemnioperms (conifers) - seed bearing
   protista - algae and kelp
    form most O2 in atmosphere
 Leaf
  wax cuticle (on top) - prevents evaporation of water off leaves
  stomata (bottom) - transport of ions therefore water, gas exchange, water vapor exchange
  vein - (middle of cell) - deliver water and take away sugars
  chloroplasts (stud epidermis) - photosynthesis
   in green cells
   light -> ATP + NADPH -> Calvin Cycle -> CH2O (Sugar)
   Structure
    double membrane
     engulfed twice
    thylacoid - area where H+ ions are stored
    granum - stacked thylacoids
 Light
  short wavelength = high energy
  long wavelength = low energy
  all wavelengths except green are used in chloroplasts
  Engelmann
   film of aerobic bacteria
   rainbow of light across film
   determined what wavelengths chloroplasts use best
 Chlorophyll
  a - -CH3 group
  b - -CHO group
  Porphyrin ring
   light absorbing
   head of chloraphil
   resonant structure
   N attracted to Mg in center
   hydrophilic due to O
  hydrocarbon tail
   hydrophobic
   tethered into membrane
 Electron Excitement
  photon hits chlorophyll
  e- moves to excited state
  e- dexcites
   releases heat and red light
   energy used in photosynthesis
 Photosystem
  takes place in inter membrane protein in thylacoid
  Process
   energy transferred to central pair of chlorophyll a
   eject e- to Primary e- acceptor
