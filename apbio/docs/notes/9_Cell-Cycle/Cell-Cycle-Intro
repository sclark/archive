Cell Cycle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlOQFWL_b98)
 how cells make more cells
 a life cycle from production to splitting
 Chromosomes
  linear in eucaryotes
  diploid - has a pair (2) chromosomes (most eucaryotes)
  haploid - has a (1) chromosome
  polyploid - has a many chromosomes
  Chromeo Type - shows all the chromosomes together
  autosomes - chromosomes that do not determine gender
   humans have 22 pairs
  gender chromosomes - chromosomes that determine gender
   humans have 1 pair
   very different from each other (unlike autosomes)
  composed of 1 strand of DNA (unless dividing, 2 DNA)
   sister cromatids - strands of DNA in chromosome, coupled when dividing
    stay attached until pulled apart
   centromere - location where cromatids are attached
   telomeres - end caps of DNA, protect end of chromosome
  DNA review
   made of neucleic acids
   4 bases A,T,C,G
   double helix
 InterPhase - G1, G0, and G2 stages of the Cell Cycle
 G1
  starts after cell has been produced from division
  recovers from division
  grows to full size
  specializes to carry out a function
 (cell may decide to specialize here and no longer divide)
 G0
  most time spent here
  cell preforming function
 S (DNA Synthesis)
  DNA is copied, using ATP
   now needs to divide or will die, no 2 copies of DNA
 G2
  preparation for division
  grows larger
  organelles divide
  centrisomes form
   with centriole pairs
  chromosomes in neucleus (duplicated but uncondensed)
 (mitosis and cytokinesis in next notes)
