 Mitosis - division of genetic materials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOt43IcV-I0)
  separate 2 DNA copies
  divide cell into genetically identical cells
  Prophase
   packing of chromosomes
    packing prevents breaking of chromosomes
    when microscopes can see chromosomes
   cloisonne disappear
   microtubials (spindle fibers) form and attach to centrisomeres
  Pro-Meta Phase
   clearly visible chromosomes
   centrisomes at opposite ends of cell
   kinetochores - microtubials attach to centrimere of chromosomes
   nonkinetochores - microtubials provide structure
  Metaphase
   chromosomes lined up across center of cell
    centrimeres pulled from both sides
  Anaphase
   sister cromatids (DNA strands) separated and pulled to individual sides
   nonkinetochore elongate cell
  Telophase
   new nuclei form
   cleavage - membrane pinches
    plant cells -> vesicals -> cell plate -> divide cell
   final part of cell division
 Cytokinesis - division of cellular materials
  nucleus formed
  one centriole
  new membrane
   due to nonkinetochore microtubials
 Experimentation
  part of microtubials marked with a dye in Meta and AnaPhase
  the mark did not move meaning microtubials fall apart at tips near centresomes
  motor proteins likely carry cromatid along microtubial
 Bacterial Cell Division - Binary Fission
  single chromosome is copied onto two different sides
  cell divides along center
 Evolution
  multiple steps
   many different cells use different microtubials, cleavage formations
