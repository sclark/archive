Cell Cycle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A12zL7F66lg)
 Control of System
  decide to continue or stop 
  G1 Checkpoint
   most important
   internal and external signals
   determines if more cells are necesary
    enters G0 on stop
    continues Mitosis on go
  G2 Checkpoint
   DNA Synthesis complete
   DNA damage
    enters G2 on Go
    waits to enter G2 on stop
  M Checkpoint
   determines if cell is ready to divide (all chromosomes attached)
  Growth Factors
   act at begining of S phase   
   PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor)
    external signal to determine if more cells are necessary
    repair injuries
   Density Dependent Inhibition
    must be attached to divide
    must not be too tightly packed to divide
   DNA damage
   neutrient deficency
  Experimentation
   Cytoplasmic factors
    S and G1 cells fused
    both cells entered S phase
    M and G1 cells fused
    both cells entered M phase
     how, DNA synthesis?
  Process
   Signals, Growth Factors, DNA damage (proto-oncagenes) -> CDK (Cyclin Dependent Kinase)
    proto-oncagenes - regulate signals for division (receptiors)
    oncagenes - mutant version of above (always on)
    tumor supressor - regulates off signals for division (stop signal receptor)
    regulated by cyclin (alosteric activator)
     cycles in concentrations
     above threshold, cell enters a phase
    activates via phosphorilation
    pair for each phase of cell cycle
  Tumors
   form with lack of stop signals or excess go signals
   start with single cell
   problematic when inhibitors no longer work
   detached tumors can move when matasticized
   attract blood vessels
  Activities
   Tumor flouresence
    tumor cells have flourcent dye
     seems that tumor cell inhibitor functions
      fewer cells with tumor inhibitor dye than positive control
   Cell Cycle phase identification
 Apoptosis - programmed death
  important for developemental phase, loss of webbing
  important for tumor defence
