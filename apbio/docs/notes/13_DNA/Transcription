Transcription ()
 DNA -> RNA
 RNA polymerase
  split H-Bonds
  use one DNA strand as template
  create RNA strand
 1. Initiation
  RNA polymerase finds correct position (promoter) to start copying
  promoter region - defines starting position for a gene by attracting RNA polymerase
   always has TATA
 2. Elongation
  RNA polymerase base pairs with DNA strand
  adds onto 3' end of RNA
  read from 3' to 5' on DNA
  Ribonucleosides - ATP, UTP (replaces TTP), CTP, GTP
 3. Termination
  sequence tells RNA polymerase to fall off
  have RNA transcript for a gene
 Cutting
  DNA:     (promoter)(start codeon)(exon1)(interon1)(exon2)(interon2)(exon3)(stop codeon)(terminator) 5'
  pre-RNA: (promoter)(start codeon)(exon1)(interon1)(exon2)(interon2)(exon3)(stop codeon)(terminator) 3'
  mRNA:    (promoter)(start codeon)(exon1)----------(exon2)----------(exon3)-------------terminator) 3'
  allows cutting and pasting of protein makeup
 Prokaryotes vs Eucaryotes
  Prokaryotes
   Location: Cytoplasm
   Gene Structure: No interons
   Changes to mRNA: No caps or poly A's
  Eucaryotes
   Location: Cytoplasm and Neucleus
   Gene Structure: Interons interrupt DNA sequence
   Changes to mRNA: 5' caps and 3' poly A's
 Interons
  Discovery
   Break H-bonds between DNA and add probe
   some cases: probe binds to DNA perfectly as expected
   some cases: probe binds but makes bubles (not binding to iteron)
  Removal
   snRNP "snerps" - Small Neuclear Ribo Neuclear Protein
   Process
    find splice sites and loop interon
    snRNP bind to another snRNP to make loop of interon
    cut loop out of mRNA
   TODO: How does this allow mixing of exons?
 Caps
  added to mRNA
  5': backwards Guanine (G cap)
  3': poly A tail of varying length
  protection from degredation
 Genitic Code
  use 3 RNA bases to create a amino acid
  redundance allows for wobble (mistakes)
  three stop codeons
  one start codeon (only want to start once)
  TODO: What is ribosome copies from the other strand of DNA, the RNA is different and therefore codes for a different protien (b/c only 64 one way possibilities)?
