Morgan and the Flies (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABDafoTazos)
 done 1910 by Thomas Hunt Morgan
  worked with fruit flies
   more sophisticated than plants
   repoduce rapidly
   easy to maintain
  treated larva with mutagins
 symbols
  b+ means normal (dominant)
  b means recessive
 procedure
  test cross two flies of BbVgvg (female) + bbvgvg (male)
   expect
    25% BbVgvg
    25% bbvgvg
    25% Bbvgvg
    25% bbVgvg
   actually
    >25% BbVgvg
    >25% bbvgvg
    <25% Bbvgvg
    <25% bbVgvg
   conclusion
    violate independent assortment
    will depend on the distance frome eachother chromosomes are druing meosis
     recumbinants (non-parents)/total offspring = disance in centiograms alleles crossed are apart
 punant squares
  w+w+ (female) + w+y (male)
     |w  |y  |
   w+|w+w|w+y|
   w+|w+w|w+y|
   phenotypes: 100% red eyes
 sex-linked disorders
  hemophilia
  red/green color blindness
  muscular distrophy
 disabling of X chromosomes
  females disable one X ino Barr bodies early in developement
