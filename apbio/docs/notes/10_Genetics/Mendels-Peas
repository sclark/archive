Mendel and the Peas (www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQOFE5mdS9g)
 was an Austrian monk in 1860's
 Peas
  flower parts
   carpel - female organ
   ovule - contains eggs in carpel
   stamen - male organ fertalizes eggs
  able to control fertilization via removing stamen
 Genetics
  Pure Breeding - pure brreding homozygus genes, two copies of same allel
  P - parent generation
  F1 - First generation
  F2 - Second generation
  Allele - different versions of a gene
  Locus - locatio of allele on chromosome
  Heterozygotes - carry both recessive and dominant gene
  Homozygotes - carry only the recessive or only the dominant gene
  Genotype - represent all contained alleles
  Penotype - represent represented alleles
  Laws
   Independent Assortment - crossin over on metaphase plate
  Tests
   Test unknown with recessive homozygote
    domonant homozygous yields all dominant phenotype
    dominant heterozygous yields dominant and recessive phenotypes
  Puntant Square
   excersize in class
