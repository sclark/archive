Alleles, Genotypes, Phenotypes (www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnk1OYaq3CE)
 Exceptions to Mendele's Rules
  Multiple Alleles for same Gene (Bunny color)
   Phenotypes: dary gray, chinchilla, point restricted, albino
  Incomplete Dominance - mixing of genes (Snap dragons)
   homozygus red and white snapdragons produce heterozygus F1
   heterozygous F1 appear pink due to mingiling of red and white pigment
   follow Mendele rules b/c pink just represents heterozygotes instead of dominant phenoype
  Blood Type folows Incomplete Dominance and Multiple Alleles
  Epistatisasus - trait determined by two genes (Lab coat color)
   can be either black or brown
   also can have color deposits or no color deposits
