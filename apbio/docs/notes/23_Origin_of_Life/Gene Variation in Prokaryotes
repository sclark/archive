Gene Variation in Prokaryotes
 Hoizontal transfer - transfer of genetic material  to organisms that are atthe same time period
  Transformation
   Griffin and Avery (see old experiment)
    showed that something was transfered form 1 bacteria to another
     when cell membrance removed, DNA is in tact, and absorbed by other bacteria
  Transduction
   phage - a virus that infects bacteria
   virus may carry bacterial DNA and deposit in another bacteria
  Conjunction
   plasmid (fertility plasmid) connects with other bacteria and shares plasmid
