 Steps:
  1. organic monomers from inorganic molecules (NH3, H2O, CH4, H2)
   miller-urey
    turns out [] were not accurate?
   oro - adenine
  2. polymers
   cech - ribozymes (self replicating RNA)
    only replicate once?
  3. protobionts/protocell
   formed fro lipids and protien
  4. cells with genetic material
   out compete with lack of materials in earth
  5. lipid membrane, DNA genome, Ribosomes
 Where?
  in H2O(l)
   Black smokers Sulfur @ 400F
    need Sun
     rely on Photosynthetic pathways
   White smokers @ 150F
    no communities of animals
    no O2
    no Sun
   Panspermia
    come on asterioids
