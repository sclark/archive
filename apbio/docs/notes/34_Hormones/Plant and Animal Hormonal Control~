Plant and Animal Hormonal Control (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4tuKeygF7g)
 Animals
  large proteins
  specific glands
  work far away
  very specific
  insulin made by pancreas
  growth hormone is water soluble secreted by pituarity gland
  steroid very soluble
   aldosterone - have receptors in cell
   cortisol - have receptors in cell
  amine hormones
   thyosine  can undergo small changes to become epinephrine (adrenalin)
    see a sanke
	 brain seessnake
	 adrenal glands on kidney release adrelanin
	  acts on all cells to
	   fat : produce energy
	   heart : pump faster
	 epinerphrine bind (B/a1/a2) Adrenergic receptors (G-coupled Proteins)
	  some cells use to make cAMP, release signals
  pituarity gland
   bottom of brain
   anterior - involed in reproduction
   posterior - 
  adrenal glands
   ontop of kidneys
   release cortico sterioids
 Plants
  small organic molecules
  no special glands
  work close by or far away
  not very specific
  growth inducing
   Auxin
    produced all over
    elongates cell
    found at tips
   Cytokinins
    promote cell division
   Gibberelling
    promote seed germination
    promote fruit
  end of growth
   Abscisic acid
    maintain seed dormancy
   Brassinosteriods
    promote stem and pollen elongation
   ethylene
    promotes fruit ripening
  phototropism
   if light hits plant on one side, Auxin expressed on other to grow toward light
