Reproduction (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQTQxVHOqz0)
 even animals can reproduce asexually
 make gametes
  sperm: meiosis 1, meiosis 2, sperm (head: capsid, tail: mitochondria flagella)
  eggs (oogenesis): meiotic division, (wait for fertilization), second meiotic division
 sea urchin
  eggs
   large protected jelly coat
   acrosome on sperm head chews through jelly coat
   receptor binding evnt
   sperm head gets in
   fertilization
 humans
  producing sperm
   sections
    vas defrens
    epididymis
    seminiferous tubules
     diploid start on outside
     differentiate as they move to center to become sperm
     sertoli and nursing cells are medium and nures sperm
   hormones (males)
    hypothalamus controls reproduction
     releases GnRH
    acts on pituarity (anterior)
     releases LH
      acts on Leydig cells
       produce testosterone
       feedback loop on hypothaamous and petuarity
     releases FSH
      acts on Sertoli cells
       produce Spermatogenesis and Inhibin
        inhibin: feedback loop on petuarity
   hormones (females)
    hypothalamus controls reproduction
     releases GnRH
    acts on pituarity (anterior)
     releases LH
      acts on Thecal cells
       produce androgens, that become estrogen
       estrogen: feedback loop on hypothaamous and petuarity
     releases FSH
      acts on Granulosa cells
       produce Inhibin
        inhibin: feedback loop on petuarity
   woman organs
    ovaries hang of ueterus
     alternate producing eggs
     recieves signal from FSH
     oocyte begins developing
      ruptures from ovary halfway through cycle
    fallopian tubes carry egg from ovaries to ueterus
     fertilized in faloppian tubes
     3-5 days before in ueterus
    implants in ueterus
     release HCG to maintain lining
    build up ueteran wall
