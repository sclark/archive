Developement ()
 steps in fertilization and developement
  acrosome reaction - sperm eats jelly coat of egg
  signal transduction (Ca++ wave) prevent other sperm from entering
  neuclei fuse
  (in frogs and flies) grey cresent forms
  cleavage
  blastula (blastocyst in humans)
  grastulation
  three layers dvelope
   endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm
  neural tube forms
  growth
 frogs
  pigment egg
   dark animal pole (top)
   light vegetal pole (boottom)
  sperm enters
  inner cytoplasm shifts
  gray cresent forms on one side
   indicates molecules are moving in cell
 cleavage
  full cleavage (frog, sea urchin)
  partil (zebra fish, flies)
 differentiation (determination)
  establish three layers (fate map)
   endoderm - lining of gut, liver, and lungs
   mesoderm - kidneys, bones, blood
   ectoderm - epidermis
 gastrulation
  sea urchin
   cells push through layer, and pull one side through
    use strings and bending to accomplish
    form digestive tube
  frogs
   dorsal lip leads cells through to create digestive tract
    if dorsal lip cells moves, embryo will form in different spot
  humans and birds
   start as a sheet
 neuralation
  ectoderm migrates together to form neural fold and groove
   groove taken in and forms tube (nodo tube)
   fold taken in and forms neural crest cells
  humans
   beural tube grows and bulges
   medula is largest and grows first
   cerebrum grows last
   eye is out-growth of brain
 somites
  responsible for segmentation
  stay near neural tube
  desinigrate and signal differentiation in vertabrites
 humans
  trophoblast - outside cells that implant
  blastocyel - inside cells give rise to embryo
  placenta
   nurishes the embryo in mother
   mother blood pools and embryo capalaries take up O2 protected by a membrane
   forms umbilical cord
