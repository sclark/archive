Cell Signaling Mechanism (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfr2f4Er0xg)
 Local/Paracrine Signaling (Next Door)
 Synaptic Signaling
  Neuron - Target (Neuron/Mussel)
 Long Distance/Endocrine (hormine) signaling
  Travel through bodily fluids (blood stream)
  reaction in target
 Stages
  Receptor
   on surface
   specific to signal (ligand)
  Relay 
   multiple processes and molecules
  Response
   change in cytoplasm, gene actiavtion, organelees
 Simple Systems
  Gated Channel
   receptor in mmbrance
   open under certial circumstances
   signal bindas to receptor
    opens channel into cell
    ions move into cytoplasm
   signal broken down/ falls off
  testostorone (similar to cholestoral)
   pass through membrane
   receptor in cytoplasm
   complex moves to neucles
    effects DNA
 More Complex
  signal -> receptor -> kynases (enzymes)
   add phosphates down a chain
   phosphoric cascade
    can exponentially increase a signal
 Example: G Protein
  signal -> receptor w/ G Protein
   G Protien moves along membrance to target
  eponephrine
   signal -> receptor w G Protien -> Adenylyl  cAMP -> removes glucose from glycogen
   Earl Sutherland won Nobel Prize for discovery
 Example: Growth Factor
  signal -> receptor -> transduction -> response (turn on genes)
