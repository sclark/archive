Enzymes (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgTO6e3cLNA)
 Name Recognition
  -ase: means enzyme
  hex-: working with glucose (6 carbon ring)
  -kin-: move phosphates around
 Function
  lower activation energy of a reaction
  put together and break apart
  enzymes are never used up
 Structure
  Active Site - folded pocket that will fit a certain substrate
  Substrate - binds to folded pocket of an enzyme
  induced fit - shape of both molecules changes when bonding b/c not exactly the same shape
 Protein nature
  operate in certain temperature
   denatures in high temperature (from human body, survive if thermophillic enzyme)
  operate in certain pH
   effects terceary and secondary structure
   trypsin (intestine) works best at 8.5
   pepsin (stomach) works best at 2.5
 Stopping and Stabilizing enzymes
  cofactor - small (often ions) that bonds in the Active Site and help bind substrate to the Active Site
  competitive inhibition - molecule will bind to Active Site (reversible)
  non-competitive inhibition - molecule binds to another site changing shape of Active site (not reversible)
  allosteric inhibitor - inhibitor molecule binds to enzyme to disallow binding o Active Site
  (oscillates w/)
  allosteric activator - activator molecule binds to enzyme stabilizing it
  cooperativity (activation) - substrate binds to one sub unit activation other sub units
  Feedback (inhibition)
   Threonine binds to active site -> enzyme chain -> isolucine (allosteric inhibitor, changing shape of Active Site) -> used up isolucine (Active Site available) -> Threonine binds to active site
 Mitochondria (enzymes at work)
  filled with enzyme jelly
  recharges ATP
 Sucrose (+H2O) -> Glucose + Fructose (carried out by Sucrase enzyme)
