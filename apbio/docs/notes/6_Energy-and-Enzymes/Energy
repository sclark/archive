Energy (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9VQ8_r6-nA)
 Catabolic - breaking down (do work)
 Anabolic - building up (creating order)
 Metabolic - catabolic and anabolic together
 Potential - stored energy
 Kinetic - energy of motion
 Thermodynamics
  1. energy not created or destroyed
  2. energy dissipated as disorder and heat
 Gibbs free energy - ΔG=ΔH-TΔS
  work used to carry out cellular functions
  Exergonic reaction (spontaneous)
   energy released through reaction
   Eproducts < Ereactants
   ΔG<0
  Endergonic (non-spontaneous)
   energy required to carry out reaction (can be from surroundings, iron rusting)
   Eproducts > Ereactants
   ΔG>0
  Closed system
   eventually reaches equilibrium
   ΔG=0 -> dead
  Open system
   will not necessarily reach equilibrium
 ATP!
  Adenine-Ribose-3x phosphates (http://avonapbio.pbworks.com/f/atp.jpg)
  ATP (+H2O) -> ADP ΔG=7.3Cal/mol
   hydrolysis reaction
  Glutamine synthesis from Glutamic acid
   GA + ATP -> GA(w/ P) + ADP + NH3 -> GA(NH3) + ADP + P
  phosphorylate a transport protein to move ions against concentration gradient
  motor protein (change shape -> whipping effect, 1x ATP per step)
  recharged in Mitochondria
 Activation Energy
  enzymes lower activation energy
