Eucaryotes DNA Sequencing
 dideoxyNTPs used to terminate DNA chains
  with enough chemicals, every posibility is made
  run a gel, computer analyzes base that was radio tagged at ecah position
  use degenerate primers to bind to multiiple lcations
 gene chip (micro array) analysis
  analyze gene expression
   used to find expressed RNA (really cDNA) or proteines
 noncoding DNA
  regulatory elements
  introns
  transposons
   parts of DNA that can move around genome
   cut-paste - transposon
   copy-paste - retrotransposon
   always have long terminal repeates
    palendromic sequences allowing treasposin to be cut
   code for moving enzyme
  repetative DNA
 gene family
  similar is structure and function
  often from gene duplication
  Hox genes/homeobox - tell what sections of the body
  molecular evidence for evolution
   evo-devo
