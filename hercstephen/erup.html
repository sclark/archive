      <td>It was a normal summer day in Herculaneum, until a small surge of lava 
        came out of <a href="gloss.html">Vesuvius</a> at 1p.m. in the afternoon 
        AD 79. People then started to flee with their valuables. At 12a.m. in 
        the morning, the mushroom cloud reached 19 miles high. The ash deposits 
        started to fall over the neighboring town of <a href="gloss.html">Pompeii</a>. 
        A cloud over 900 degrees Fahrenheit then covered Herculaneum which occurred 
        at 1a.m.. There were five more surges that followed. These occurred at 
        2a.m., 6:30a.m., 7:30a.m, 7:45a.m. and the final surge occurred at 8:15a.m.. 
        This volcanic eruption was the greatest eruption ever.<br></td>
