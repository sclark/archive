      <td>Herculaneum was a dream town. There were several reasons for this. The 
        first is that it had a bay view. It overlooked the <a href="gloss.html">Bay 
        of Naples</a>. Because of the view, many wealthy people wanted to move 
        there to live. The wealthy people spent their savings on their homes to 
        add things like gardens, exotic plants, and other modern conveniences. 
        Herculaneum contained many <a href="gloss.html">villas</a> which it was 
        famous for. One of the modern conveniences and technological advancements 
        was the heating system in their homes. This system would pump hot air 
        through the cavities in walls. Herculaneum also controlled the distribution 
        of water by forcing it through <a href="gloss.html">aquaeductus</a>. Then, 
        the water went into underground pipes where by using hydraulic forces, 
        it was pumped into the homes, public buildings, and fountains. The people 
        in Herculaneum counted Roman miles using a gear. This gear attached to 
        the back wheel that would spin and drop a pebble into a box for every 
        Roman mile traveled.<br></td>
