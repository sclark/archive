      <td> During the excavation, it was thought that the people of Herculaneum 
        died of <a href="gloss.html">asphyxiation</a> presumably from thermal shock. 
        More than 300 bodies of the total population of 5000 were uncovered. The 
        adults and valuables were found at the top of the lava, while the children 
        were buried deeper down. Eighty intact bodies were discovered in twelve 
        store rooms on the coast. Using DNA test, high powered microscopes, and 
        3-D forensic techniques, scientists were able to recreate faces of some 
        of the people in Herculaneum. Their appearance was not too dissimilar 
        from us.</td>
